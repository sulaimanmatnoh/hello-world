Just another repository

Hi all!

Man here, I am currently a noob that wan't to learn web development properly.

I have go through a hard patch of learning to code, JavaScript especially!
From now on, i want to start fresh and learn harder to improve my skills

I have some basics in HTML and CSS and a very little bit of JS.

My only hope right now i will succeed to be a front-end developer and want to know deeply how to make Wordpress theme from scratch.

I guess i will need to learn PHP and Wordpress, since i have no experience. I think this will be hard and mindfuck me for a very long time. Support me guys!

Lots of love, Sulaiman.
